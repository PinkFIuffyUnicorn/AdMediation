- Import all needed imports: <br/>
`$ go get github.com/gorilla/mux`<br/>
`$ go get github.com/thedevsaddam/gojsonq`
- Run command `$ gcloud app deploy`

# Attributes
id = int64<br/>
description = string<br/>
value = int<br/>
platform = string<br/>
osversion = string<br/>
appname = string<br/>
appversion = string<br/>
countrycode = string<br/>
adtype = string

# Assumptions
- For added logic `AdMob doesnâ€™t work on any android os version 9 so it should be returned to the app, but works on other os versions`, assumed it meant shouldn't and not should
- No database was created to save the values, everything is saved in `output.txt`
- When Query-ing data and the response is empty, the response is replaced with a list of all Ad Networks (if the parameter platform was used in Query, the response is also Query-ed to that platform)
